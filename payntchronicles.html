       <h3>The Paynt Chronicles Rewards</h3>
       <p class="editable">The Paynt Chronicals is a series of interconnected animations, each split between 5 original @Bstract pieces of Art. Once a collector owns a complete set of 5, I will then create them their own Bstract Art Collection named after them, They will also collect part of all future royalties on the pieces in their named collection.</p>
       <p class="editable">A named collection will only be given to the first collector of each set of 5, meaning there are only 10 named collections available. </p>
       <p class="editable">To complete a set you will only need the middle “scene” painting, The other 4 pieces can be used from any set as long as the animation can still be completed, i.e Two figures walking from both sides meeting in the middle piece. </p>
